    Vendored from dask.utils because it is used parts of tiled that do not

    This wraps a normal ``threading.Lock`` object and satisfies the same
    interface.  However, this lock can also be serialized and sent to different
    processes.  It will not block concurrent operations between processes (for
    this you should look at ``multiprocessing.Lock`` or ``locket.lock_file``
    but will consistently deserialize into the same lock.
    So if we make a lock in one process::
        lock = SerializableLock()
    And then send it over to another process multiple times::
        bytes = pickle.dumps(lock)
        a = pickle.loads(bytes)
        b = pickle.loads(bytes)
    Then the deserialized objects will operate as though they were the same
    lock, and collide as appropriate.
    This is useful for consistently protecting resources on a per-process
    level.
    The creation of locks is itself not threadsafe.
